### What I learned

Altough a very simple project, there are always small things that might be difficult and take time to solve. One from the html and css section was the email response p element which was a bit tricky to line up with the input placeholder text but it wasn't too hard. The other was the Javascript. Still a beginner in it, I still find it hard naturally but with so many resources online my way of writing the correct code is not far away. It was a fun, small project and I've learned some more. Ready to start my next small project and continuing my learning.
